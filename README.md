# language-vue-jsx

This package adds support for `.vue` files like [language-vue](https://github.com/hedefalk/atom-vue),
but allows you to use `jsx` and new `JavaScript` features, as if you had the
[language-babel](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel) package installed,
only with the difference that it all works!
